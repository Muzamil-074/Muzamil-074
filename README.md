# 💫 About Me

Hi, I’m **Muzamil Dars** 👋  
I am a **Software Engineering student at Mehran University of Engineering & Technology (MUET)** and a passionate **Full-Stack Web Developer** with hands-on experience in building modern, scalable, and user-focused web applications.

I primarily work with the **MERN stack** and enjoy developing clean, efficient solutions that solve real-world problems. My interests also extend into **Artificial Intelligence**, where I continuously explore new tools, concepts, and applications.

Alongside development, I actively strengthen my **problem-solving skills** through **Data Structures & Algorithms**, regularly practicing on platforms like **LeetCode**. I believe in writing clean code, understanding system design fundamentals, and continuously improving through learning and practice.
